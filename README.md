# FloodGuard: Identifying and Defending Against SYN and UDP DDoS Attacks

## Project Overview

FloodGuard is a robust system designed to identify and defend against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, specifically focusing on **SYN** and **UDP** flooding attacks. This project leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to effectively classify and detect these types of network-based attacks.

## Problem Statement

DDoS attacks are one of the most significant cybersecurity threats, where an attacker floods a target with traffic to overwhelm its resources, causing disruption or service outages. **SYN flooding** and **UDP flooding** are two common types of DDoS attacks that can bring down servers by sending a large number of requests. Early detection of such attacks is critical for mitigating their impact on network infrastructure.

## Approach

This project uses **LSTM** networks to model the temporal behavior of network traffic and detect anomalies indicative of **SYN** and **UDP** DDoS attacks. LSTMs are particularly effective for sequential data like network traffic, where patterns over time help distinguish between normal traffic and attack traffic.

### Key Steps:
- **Data Collection**: The dataset consists of network traffic records labeled as either normal traffic or attack traffic (SYN/UDP).
- **Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, normalized, and formatted for time series analysis, making it suitable for input into the LSTM model.
- **Model Training**: An LSTM model is trained to identify patterns in the traffic data that correspond to attack behavior.
- **Evaluation**: The modelâ€™s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are evaluated to determine its effectiveness in attack detection.

## Features:
- **Real-time detection**: Capable of identifying SYN and UDP attacks in real-time as they occur.
- **High Accuracy**: LSTM-based model provides high accuracy for detecting network anomalies caused by these attacks.
- **Scalability**: The model can be extended to handle large-scale network environments.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** for the overall implementation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the LSTM model.
- **Pandas, NumPy** for data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn** for model evaluation and performance metrics.

## Future Work
- **Integration with firewalls**: Integrating the detection system with network firewalls to automatically block malicious traffic.
- **Model Optimization**: Further optimization of the LSTM model for faster detection with minimal resource usage.
- **Broader attack detection**: Extending the model to detect other types of DDoS attacks (e.g., HTTP floods).
